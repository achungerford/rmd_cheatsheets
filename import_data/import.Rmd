# flat files

Say you want to import data in a platform-independent way. If a file `states.csv` were located in the `datasets` folder of our home directory. We would write the following code:

`path <- file.path("~", "datasets", "states.csv")`

You could then use that code: `read.csv(path, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)`.

## `read.csv()`

```{r}
# Import swimming_pools.csv
pools1 <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Alexander\\Documents\\Programming\\rmd_cheatsheets\\import_data\\swimming_pools.csv")

head(pools1)
```


```{r}
# Import swimming_pools.csv with strings as factors
pools <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Alexander\\Documents\\Programming\\rmd_cheatsheets\\import_data\\swimming_pools.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

head(pools)
```
